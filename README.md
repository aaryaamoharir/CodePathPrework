## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Spotify: 3 of my favorite Spotify features include the easy access playlists, Spotify wrapped, and the customization. The first thing that pop up when you open the app are the playlists. This makes it easy to select the playlist and as a result, song, that I would like to play. Additionally, the Spotify wrapped is a fun feature and it’s always interesting to see how many minutes I listened to Spotify and who my top artists were. Lastly, I like that it recommends songs based off of your playlists as it makes it easier to find new songs that I would like. 
2. Instagram : 3 of my favorite features include sharing reels, commenting on posts, and changing the background in messages. It’s always fun to send relatable reels to my friends or giggle whenever someone changes the background of our chat to something ironic. 
3. Dunkin Donuts: 2 of my favorite features include ordering online and easily viewing the menu. Ordering online helps me save time, especially when I am already late, and viewing the menu online makes it more convenient as I can have my order decided before I even step foot inside of the store. 
4. Libby: 2 of my favorite features include easily accessing the ebooks and accessing my library card. This app takes away the hassle of finding my library card as it’s already on my phone and makes it easier to read ebooks on the go.
5. DUO: This app makes it easier to verify my identity for two-factor authentication and another feature I appreciate is, it allows you to verify your identity from the Home Screen, without even opening the app. 

 Possible Idea for an App: A possible idea for an app would be an app that allows you to keep track of your favorite restaurants, and find restaurants near you that fit certain dietary restrictions. 

## Notes

One challenge I ran across while creating this app was connecting the code to a simulator so I could run the program. Additionally, I had trouble creating the IBAction as I wasn’t able to Control + drag from the button. To resolve this issue, I found the code for creating an IBAction and wrote the program that way instead.
